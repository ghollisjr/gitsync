+ (BUG) If an existing repository lacks a branch, and the .gitsync
  file is ed ited to include that missing branch, it causes branches
  to be merged in horrible ways.  This should be checked.  Branches
  that don't exist should either be skipped or (preferably) pulled
  from a source in a smart way.

- Add automated cloning

- Add branch support.  E.g., each line should be of the form

  <repo1> <repo2> [branch]*

  where a list of optional branches is supplied, white-space
  separated.  If no branches are supplied then only "master" is
  assumed.

  E.g.:

  /mnt/disk/repo /home/user/repo master testing

  would denote the need to synchronize both the master and testing
  branches of repositories located at /mnt/disk/repo on the removable
  drive and /home/user/repo on the local drive.
