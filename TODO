+ Add branch support.  E.g., each line should be of the form

  <repo1> <repo2> [branch]*

  where a list of optional branches is supplied, white-space
  separated.  If no branches are supplied then only "master" is
  assumed.

  E.g.:

  /mnt/disk/repo /home/user/repo master testing

  would denote the need to synchronize both the master and testing
  branches of repositories located at /mnt/disk/repo on the removable
  drive and /home/user/repo on the local drive.
